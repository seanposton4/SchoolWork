I could never get a downloadable compiler to work for whatever reason,
so I had to resort to using an online compiler. This actually worked for
a while, until the compiler decided it didn't to do its job anymore.
Perhaps the online compiler isn't capable of handling the amount of code
that I had. So, for the final bit of the code I had go without testing.
Another issue I had is that some of the strategies I used for the past
grade reports I could'nt quite get to work in cobol. One example of this
is that I tried to store each unique assignment category into an array,
which helps display the assignments later easier. I could not find a way
in Cobol to check if a value was already in the array, so I had to scrap
that idea altogether.
