Proofs:

2 = 1
x = y
x^2 = yx
x^2 - y^2 = yx - y^2
(x - y)(x + y) = y(x - y)
x + y = y
y + y = y
2y = y
2 = 1 PROVED (FLAWED)

Terminologies:

Conjecture: statement that is being proposed to be true
Theorem: a statment that has been shown to be true (it is proved)
Axioms/postulates: statements we assume to be true
	1 = 1; x = y, y = x
Lemma: a lesser theorem that is helpful in the proof of theorems
Corollary: theorem that can be established directly from a proven theorem

Direct Proofs:

Use facts, lemma, axioms, other theorms to prove statement.

k is an element of integer
2k - even
2k + 1 - odd
Ex 1: if n is an odd, then n^2 is an odd number
(2k + 1)^2 
= 4k^2 + 4k + 1
= 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1
2k^2 + 2k = k
= 2k + 1

Ex 2: if n is an even integer, then (-1)^n = 1
	(-1)^2 = 1
	(-1)^4 = 1
	(-1)^6 = 1
		can't just keep doing this infinitely
(-1)^(2k)
= ((-1)^2)^k
= (1)^k
= 1

Ex 3: if a|b and a|c then a|(b+c)
	a = 2
	b = 10
	c = 8
	
b / a = r
b = a * r
	there is an integer such that r * a will be b

c / a = t
c = a * t
	there is an integer such that r * a will be c
	
b + c = ar + at 
= a(r + t)
